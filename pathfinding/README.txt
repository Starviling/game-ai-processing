The project is named pathfinding. For more specific intstructions on how to run the
program, please refer to the PDF file for the project and its individual sections.

-pathfinding holds the setup, rendering, graph generation, and obstacle generation
-Boid holds the representation for the boid and the breadcrumbs associated with it
-astar holds the A* algorithm graph search implementation.
-dijkstra holds the Dijkstra's algorithm graph search implementation
-european_union holds the map generation for the european union
-follow holds the logic for following a path generated by shortestpath
-graph the representation of the graph including the nodes, edges, and how to draw itself
-greedy holds the Greedy Best First Search graph search implementation
-grid_rooms the representation of the graph of 3 rooms and obstacles
-heuristic holds 5 different heuristics implemented
-orientation the orientation of the Boid
-random_graph the representation of the randomly generated graph based on a seed
-util extraneous methods/classes utilized throughout the project


util, follow, graph, greedy, pathfinding, & heuristic hold code based off of lecture material.
astar & dijkstra hold code that is based off of textbook material.
