All the methods for the behaviors to be demonstrated can be found in scenario.pde,
given that all the other .pde files are loaded in.

basic_motion.pde holds the part one algorithm
arrive_steering.pde holds the part two algorithm
wander_steering.pde holds the part three algorithm
flocking_behavior.pde holds the part 4 algorithm

All the other .pde fills hold essential parts used by behaviors.

To run each part individually, you can refer to the PDF or follow the instructions below.
The name of the first .pde created was wander_steering.pde
  Part 1:
scenario.pde -> setup() -> uncomment firstBasicMotion()
